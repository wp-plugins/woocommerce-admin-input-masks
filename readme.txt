It masks some woocommerce inputs on the admin side. For the moment, only the price.

== Description ==

Woocommerce simply doesn't use any type of mask on the admin side. So while you are registering your products, you can mistype your price by accident, for example typing a letter instead of a number, or using a wrong decimal separator.

Whenever it's possible, this plugin creates masks using native Woocommerce configurations that are already in use on the front end, so they can work on the admin side too.
